# Architecture Overview

This document explains the core architectural design of the **AGI-ColdCases** prototype.

---

## 🧠 High-Level System Overview

The AGI-ColdCases architecture is a **hybrid system** designed to demonstrate *structurally accountable reasoning* — combining:

> 🧮 Numeric computation  
> 🔍 Symbolic reasoning  
> 🔗 Lossless semantic integration  
> 📊 Causal auditing

These components work together to produce decisions that are not only *effective* but also *auditable* and *provably ethical*.

## 🧱 Core Components

### 📌 1. Numeric Hub (Python Body)
Responsible for:
- Sensor simulation and forecasting
- Risk scoring and numerical analysis
- Time-series progression of scenarios

This layer handles high-volume numeric data efficiently.

**Key files:**  
`numeric_hub.py`

---

### 📌 2. Symbolic Hub (Lisp Soul)
Responsible for:
- Symbolic logic and rule evaluation
- Ethical constraint enforcement
- Priority hierarchies encoded as immutable logic

This layer encodes *axiomatic* reasoning.

**Key files:**  
`symbolic_hub.py`

---

### 📌 3. Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA — The Bridge)

VSA provides:
- **Lossless binding** of data vectors and ethical constraint vectors
- Reversible representations (unbinding proofs)
- Mathematical auditability

Unlike traditional neural mixing (where constraints get “smeared”), VSA ensures structural identity persists.

### 📌 4. Emergency Focus Protocol

A dynamic meta-module that:
- Monitors difficulty and uncertainty
- Reconfigures resources when critical thresholds are exceeded
- Tightens audit requirements under high-stakes scenarios

This mimics human crisis focus in software.

---

### 📌 5. Audit Logging

Every decision is:
- Timestamped
- Justified
- Traceable to the exact constraint set and data snapshot

Logs can be re-evaluated, audited, and analyzed independently.
