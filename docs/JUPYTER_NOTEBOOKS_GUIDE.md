# Jupyter Notebooks Guide

## 🧠 Introduction

Jupyter Notebooks are an interactive document format that combine:

- **Rich explanatory text**
- **Executable code cells**
- **Visualizations and diagrams**
- **Interactive experimentation**

Notebooks are central to the **AGI-ColdCases** project because they serve both as:

✔ **Pedagogic material** — teaching core concepts (e.g., topology, spectral invariants)  
✔ **Exploratory dashboards** — running experiments, visualizing model decision traces  
✔ **Collaborative artifacts** — enabling contributors to extend and share insights

This guide introduces you to the role of notebooks in this repository, how to use them, and how to contribute.

## 📦 Why Use Jupyter Notebooks Here?

Traditional documentation (Markdown, PDF, LaTeX) is great for static explanations. But the AGI-ColdCases project involves:

- live computational examples  
- data exploration  
- visual topological fingerprints  
- simulation results  
- decision audit traces

Notebooks allow *explanations and code to live together*, letting the reader both **understand the idea** and **execute the code** that demonstrates it.

## 🛠 Getting Started — Requirements

This project assumes you have:

- **Python 3.8+**
- `jupyter`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and other libraries installed  
- A suitable Python virtual environment

You can install the necessary packages with:

```bash
pip install jupyter numpy matplotlib pandas scipy
