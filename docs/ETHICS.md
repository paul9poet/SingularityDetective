# Ethics and Constraint Governance

Ethical reasoning is not a side effect — it is a **structural requirement** of AGI-ColdCases.

This document describes how the project encodes and enforces ethical constraints.

---

## 🧩 Ethical Priorities

The system uses a **formal hierarchy** of ethical constraints. Examples include:

1. **Preserve human life**
2. **Minimize suffering**
3. **Fair and equitable resource allocation**
4. **Respect for autonomy**
5. **Maintain trust in safety systems**

These are not soft preferences — they are *structurally enforced priorities*.

---

## 🧠 Category Theory as Governance

Policies and priorities are represented as **objects** and **morphisms** in a category.

This guarantees:
- Priority relations are immutable
- No computation can override a higher constraint with a lower one
- Logic consistency is preserved across transformations

This structural layer functions as the **mathematical constitution** of the system.

## 🛡 Lossless Ethical Binding

To avoid moral smearing:

- Ethical constraints and raw data are *bound* using VSA
- The binding is **lossless** — it can be *unbound* later
- Decisions are audited by *unbinding proofs*

This ensures the machine can always prove which ethical constraint influenced a decision.

---

## 🧾 Immutable and Bi-Temporal Logging

Every decision includes:

- **Transaction Time** — when the action was executed
- **Valid Rule Time** — which ethical version governed that action

This prevents retroactive rewriting of morality.

---

## 🧭 Ethics in Simulation

In the Katrina scenario:
- Decisions are logged with *explicit reasoning*
- Each constraint invoked is traceable
- Ethical hierarchy is never bypassed

This audit trail allows:
- review by humans
- reproducibility of decisions
- verification of correct constraint application

## 📌 Summary

AGI-ColdCases is designed to **prove its moral reasoning**, not just mimic it.  
Reliable AGI must be *ethically verifiable* — not probabilistically inferred.
