# Emergency Focus Protocol

The **Emergency Focus Protocol** simulates how AGI reallocates resources and prioritizes reasoning under high-stakes scenarios.

---

## 📍 Normal Mode

In normal operation:
- Modules run distributed
- Numerical heuristics and symbolic shortcuts are permitted
- Focus is wide and multitasking

This is efficient but shallow.

---

## 🚨 Emergency Mode

When difficulty exceeds thresholds:


if D(P) > threshold:
Activate Emergency Mode


**Emergency Mode**:

✔ reallocates computing resources  
✔ suppresses shallow heuristics  
✔ engages deep deduction  
✔ intensifies ethical auditing  

---

## 🔥 Difficulty Metric (D)

The metric is a composite of:

- prediction uncertainty
- scenario severity
- ethical conflict weight
- consequences of error

This variable is continuously monitored.

## 🌀 What Changes in Emergency Mode?

**1. Resource Allocation**
- Numeric modules focus on relevant subsystems
- Symbolic reasoning receives priority CPU time

**2. Meta-Reasoning Activation**
- Recursive introspection kicks in
- Unbinding proofs are required before action

**3. Ethical Constraints Intensify**
- Higher threshold for accepting any action
- Strictest constraint levels apply

**4. Latent Modules Activate**
- Detailed simulation engines
- Large topology evaluators
- Expanded audit systems

## 🧠 Behavioral Effect

This mimics human crisis focus:
- narrowed attention
- maximal verification
- prioritized ethics

Under emergency, correctness *trumps* efficiency.

## 🧾 Example: Katrina T+12 hrs

When flooding and infrastructure failure occur:
- Difficulty metric spikes
- Emergency Mode engages
- Numeric hub and symbolic hubs collaborate in tight loop
- Every rescue decision is audited & justified
